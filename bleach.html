        <h1>BLEACH</h1>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <div class="opdes">
            <p>Ichigo Kurosaki was a typical high school student. However, when a corrupt spirit known as a Hollow attacked his family and injured a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki who had come to their aid, Ichigo accepted Rukia's offer to transfer her powers to him in order to protect his loved ones. To his surprise, Rukia was unable to regain her powers, tasking Ichigo with the responsibility of hunting down Hollows that haunt their town. Fortunately, he was joined by his friends Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu Ishida, each possessing their unique abilities. Together, they adapted to their new roles and supported each other both in and out of battle. As they continue to fight, Ichigo realizes that the Hollows are not the only threat to the human world.</p>
